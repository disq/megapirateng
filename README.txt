Release Notes for MegaPirateNG 2.8 R3 (ArduCopter 2.8.1a)

=== How to compile MegaPirateNG ===

1. Download and install Arduino 1.0.1!!!!
2. See additional requirements for BlackVortex boards in the release_notes_BlackVortex.txt
3. Delete original libraries folder in Arduino IDE folder
4. Copy libraries folder from MegaPirateNG distributive into Arduino IDE folder
5. Select your Frame, Sensor, Tranmitter type in the APM_config.h (Quad X, ALLINONE by default)

=== Arduino board pin mapping ===

*** RC channels (can be changed in APM_RC_PIRATES.cpp) ***
* PPM SUM signal must be connected to A8 pin
* Default is TX_mwi - MultiWii set
A8	- ROLL
A9	- THROTTLE
A10	- PITCH
A11	- YAW
A12	- AUX1
A13	- AUX2
A14	- CAMPITCH
A15	- CAMROLL

*** Camera stabilization ***
d32 - Camera stabilisation Roll servo
d33 - Camera stabilisation Pitch servo
For BlackVortex:
d44 - Camera stabilisation Roll servo
d45 - Camera stabilisation Pitch servo

Serial ports:
GPS - Serial2 (RX2,TX2)
Telemetry (3DR, Xbee, Bluetooth) - Serial3 (RX3,TX3)
OSD (Remzibi, E-OSD, FrSky) - Serial1 (RX1,TX1)

*** Sonar ***
d9 - Sonar Tx 
d10 - Sonar Echo 

*** Status LEDs ***
d13 - RED
d30 - YELLOW
d31 - GREEN

*** LED Sequencer ***
A1,A2,A3,A4 - default LED sequencer pins (read more in led.pde),

*** Motor mapping ***
motor mapping (maximize your text viewer or disable word wrapping to avoid line breaks)
